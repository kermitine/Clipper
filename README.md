Clipper is a first-of-its-kind encryption suite, which makes it virtually impossible for an encoded message to be cracked through traditional means.

A seed word is entered, which generates a 52 digit long seed. The seed is generated is consistent to the word, and not random.

CVC (Clipper Variable Cipherkey) makes scrambles the seed for each word, making it extremely difficult to crack with regular means.
